# Portfolio Page

## Description

This is my portfolio page.
It is about me and about my work.
And it includes contact information for how to reach me.
This is my first web page!

## Source Code

I sourced code from 02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/03-Ins_Flexbox-Layout as HTML starter code.


## Installation

To install this project, first I established the HTML structure, and then I styled the page with CSS.

For example, the text about my work experience came first. Then the format came next, by putting the work experience test in the left pane vertically and by positiong app images on right side.


## Usage

You can use this page to get info on my experience, work, and development projects.

Here is a screenshot of the portfolio page.
